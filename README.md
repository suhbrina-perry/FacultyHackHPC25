## Target Course Name
**CSCI1010 - Introduction to Programming I**

## Team Name: Crypto Squad

## Team Members:
- Dr. Sabrina Perry, **KeyCracker**  
  Austin Peay State University
- Dr. Izzat Alsmadi, **Byte Master**  
  Texas A&M, San Antonio
- Dr. John Holmen, **Code Enforcer**    
  Oak Ridge National Laboratory

## Target Course Goals:
- **Improve Intro to Programming with HPC Perspectives**  
A student-friendly HPC environment where first-year Java students can run small programs and observe how performance changes with scale.
  
  
- **Incorporate Generative AI for Learning Supports**  
Use AI tools to provide coding hints, error explanations, and practice problems.
Emphasize responsible use — AI as a learning partner, not a code replacement.*(Oh the places we will go!)*

- *Introduce Parallelism Concepts*  
Use classroom activities (e.g., cornhole race “one-hand parallelization” game) to explain parallel vs. sequential work.
Connect to Java Concurrency in Practice and introductory parallel programming models.*
